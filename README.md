# Snake game
Little snake game emulator.

The application uses the turtle module of python. Turtle uses tkinter module. On Linux and MacOS the tkinter library might not be installed. If you encounter such an error try to install python-tk first.

Install python-tk on MacOS:
```
brew install python-tk
```
Install python-tk on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt install python-tk
```
## navigating the snake
Use the Up, Down, Right, Left arrow keys on your keyboard to change direction with your snake.

If you want to run the program, enter to the project directory and execute the main.py with python:

git clone https://github.com/kalandonor/snake_game.git
cd snake_game
python main.py

Enjoy!
